    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 carrot, finely diced</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>24 ounces (700 grams) ground beef mince</li>
      <li>10 ounces (300 grams) ground pork mince, or beef</li>
      <li>24 ounces (700 grams) Passata</li>
      <li>14 ounces (410 grams) crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>
        3 heaped tablespoons tomato paste, (I use garlic and herbs flavoured)
      </li>
      <li>2 beef or vegetable bouillon cubes, crushed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon each dried oregano and basil</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar, (if desired)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper, season to your tastes</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, then add in the onion and
        carrots and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until softened. Add in the garlic
        and saut√© for about 1 minute, until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add beef and pork (if using) and cook while breaking it up with the end
        of your spoon, until browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the Passata, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, crushed bouillon
        and dried herbs. Mix well to combine and bring to a gentle simmer.
        Season with desired amount of salt and pepper (I use about 3/4 teaspoon
        each) and sugar if needed. Cover and cook for about 20-30 minutes,
        occasionally mixing, until the sauce has thickened slightly and meat is
        tender.
      </li>
      <li>Adjust salt, pepper and dried herbs to your taste.</li>
    </ol>
